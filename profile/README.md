# EPIC tool suite

This is a collection of tools, algorithms and viewers for genomics data, created by the EPIC project at Los Alamos National Laboratory.

### The EPIC project

Broad knowledge of epigenetic regulation of host-pathogen interactions would greatly advance
our ability to predict pathogens that have high potential to cause the next global scale catastrophe or
pandemic. Although recent progress has been made, scientists and decision makers currently lack methods
to quickly compare and identify pathogen-induced changes to host genomes to understand susceptibility
and resiliency. This repository includes the toolset developed to address the analysis and visualization 
needs for extreme scale epigenetics data.

### Links to previous work

The software developed for the EPIC project is a continuation of work previously done under Los Alamos National Laboratory's
LDRD program. [Browser](http://www.github.com/LANL/4DGB) and [workflow](https://www.github.com/4DGB) repositories developed 
under this funding resulted in toolsets that were built on in various ways by the EPIC project. This work has been summarized in this [manuscript](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2025.07.13.664622v1) 
(submitted to BMC Bioinformatics) and is publicly available on BioRxiv.
